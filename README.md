# Introduction

This is a demo project for education/training purposes of transcoding for videos on demand from MP4 to HLS

This project is based on a VM runing on Akamai cloud (A.K.A Linode) running docker, and Akamai Cloud's Object Storage (bucket).
The process is the Docker container downloading the MP4 files from the Akamai Cloud's Object Storage Intake folder, and then uploading the converted HLS files in an Output folder.
